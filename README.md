# POC: Java Validation

It demonstrates different approaches to validate data in Java applications.

We want to explore software design techniques, patterns, libraries and frameworks that aim to make it easy for us to
validate data in different type of applications. Each Gradle module demonstrates a different approach (annotation based,
interfaces, pattern) and must be self-contained.

The goal is to find out the trade-offs of each approach and not to have a production-ready line of business application.
No application is implemented here, the source code is evaluated and verified using automated unit tests managed by
JUnit.
